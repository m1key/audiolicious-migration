The goal of this project is to migrate relational Audiolicious data to NoSQL.

To build this project you need to have Audiolicious artifacts in your repository.
You can obtain the source code here: https://github.com/m1key/audiolicious

To run integration tests you need Audiolicious database which Audiolicious
integration tests create when they run.


When running Launcher from SpringSource Tool Suite, I had to manually adjust
the classpath to include src/main/resources.
